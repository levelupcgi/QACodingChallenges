# Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number?
# with loop, with recursion
# Letâ€™s see a program for factorial use recursion and for-loop by handling
# negative numbers and returning a fixed value of say -9999 for negative numbers
# which should be handled in the program calling the factorial function.
