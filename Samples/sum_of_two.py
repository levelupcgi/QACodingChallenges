# Sum of two. Write a method that accepts an int[] array and an int number, and find 2 elements in the array that
# sum is equal to the given int. Assume that an input array will have only one pair of numbers that sum equal
# to our given number. It will always have this pair. See input and output examples. I use the Brute Force algorithm.
