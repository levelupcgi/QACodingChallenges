# Sort array without built-in sort methods. In this example, we will use selection sort and bubble sort algorithms to sort our array.
#
# In selection sort, we select the smallest and swap it with the current array and we will keep doing it for each element.
# Please watch this video for a visual explanation.

# In bubble sort, we bubble out the biggest values to the right side by looping over our array and switching
# two pairs of elements if they are not in the correct order. Please watch this video for a visual explanation.
